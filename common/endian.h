// If you're unfamiliar with endian-ness, it's the order bytes are stored for
// values stored with more than 1 byte. In big endian, the largest hexidecimal
// place comes first. In little endian, it comes last (the bytes are reversed).
// The number 1738 is 06 CA in big endian, and CA 06 in little endian. Notice
// only the order of the bytes are reversed, but the order of the hex
// characters in each byte stays the same.
//
// Newer computers switched to little endian because it made addition,
// subtraction, etc. faster. On older machines this wasn't as big of a deal, so
// they used big endian. Since the Xbox 360 was big endian and most modern PCs
// are little endian, we need to reverse the byte order of every number stored
// using more than 1 byte before we use it.

// At -O1 or higher this should be optimized away

// Byte-swap any value to the opposite endian. With most data types on most
// compilers (@ -O1 or higher optimization), this becomes a single instruction.
